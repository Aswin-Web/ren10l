        Title: Revolutionizing Rental Management with Smart Technology Managing
        rental properties can be a complex and time-consuming task, especially
        for landlords, property managers, and real estate agencies overseeing
        multiple units. A well-designed rental management app can significantly
        streamline operations, automate tasks, and improve the rental experience
        for both property owners and tenants. This document explores the
